To-Do List Application
This project is a To-Do List application developed using PHP Laravel version 9. The application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with features like task addition, marking tasks as completed, viewing all tasks, and deleting tasks with a confirmation prompt.

Features
Add Task:

Tasks can be added by entering the task name and pressing the Enter button.
The task will appear on the frontend without reloading or refreshing the page.
Mark as Completed:

By clicking on the checkbox next to a task, the task will be marked as completed and will disappear from the current view.
Show All Tasks:

The "Show All Tasks" button allows users to view all tasks, both completed and non-completed.
Delete Task:

Tasks can be deleted by clicking the delete button.
A warning prompt "Are you sure to delete this task?" will appear before the task is permanently deleted.
Prevent Duplicate Tasks:

The application ensures that no duplicate tasks can be added.
